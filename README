HOW TO USE
1. Provide input .xlsx file containing required input values. A template is provided: see "aircraft_inputs.xlsx"
2. Run the file "cargo_aircraft_iteration.py"
3. The ParaPy GUI will open. To iterate and instantiate an aircraft design, click "root". If you wish to alter design
   inputs and re-iterate to arrive at a new aircraft design, simply alter the corresponding input slot and press the
   enter key or click "root". If you wish to alter inputs and rapidly see the adjusted geometry, you may do so in the
   "aircraft" tree entry. However, this will not guarantee a convergence within 0.1% of the aircraft weight.
4. In order to create and export the output files, you need to run "root" with the desired design inputs.
5. If you wish to see the plots generated by AVL as part of the design process, open the tree down to the "AVL" part,
   click on "analysis", and you will see the buttons to show the plots.
6. To export the geometry as a STEP file, open the "aircraft" part, right click on "STEP" and click "write".
7. Upon creating and export output files, the program will warn you if the created design is not stable. However, you
   will still be able to save the generated output files.
